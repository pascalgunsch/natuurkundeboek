    "## 1. Using basic input/output\n",
    "To practice with basic programming we start with an exercise, exercise 2.3 of Newman, in which we are going to make a small calculator that operates on user input of $x$ and $y$ coordinates and print the radius and angle as output. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 2.3** Write a program to perform the inverse operation to that of Example 2.2. That is, ask the user for the Cartesian coordinates $x,y$ of a point in two-dimensional space, and calculate and print the corresponding\n",
    "polar coordinates $r$, $\\theta$, with the angle $\\theta$ given in degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that theta (in degrees) is defined in the usual way and increases from the $x+$ axis in the counterclockwise direction. Note that the arctangent function has a periodicity of 180 degrees where we in fact need a function that is periodic with 360 degrees, find the function that solves this problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run your script for a few inputs $x=-1$ and $y=1$ and check your answers. "
